INT Biohackathon 2025 Team 4 Project: HUMAN RHINOVIRUS LEVERAGES MULTI-LAYERED IMMUNE EVASION MECHANISMS TO BYPASS HOST DEFENSES

Human rhinovirus (HRV), the leading cause of the common cold, remains a persistent global pathogen despite widespread exposure and repeated immune priming. With over 160 recognized types, HRV evades lasting immune memory and continues to cause recurrent infections throughout life. Despite extensive research, no vaccine has been developed due to its extensive immune evasion mechanisms. While HRV’s prevalence is well recognized, the molecular strategies enabling its immune evasion remain poorly defined. In this study, we examine HRV’s immune evasion strategies through four key layers: (1) genome composition, focusing on CpG suppression; (2) codon usage bias and its implications for immune recognition; (3) host transcriptional responses to HRV infection; and (4) evolutionary dynamics and sequence variability. While each of these aspects has been studied in isolation, their combined effects within HRV have not been fully explored. We also compare these findings with those from West Nile Virus, a zoonotic flavivirus that is a dead-end host in humans. Our results reveal a set of interlocking immune evasion strategies, including region-specific patterns of CpG suppression and TpG enrichment, codon bias driven by immune avoidance rather than translational efficiency, muted innate immune activation, and heightened sequence divergence shaped by sustained human selective pressures. These mechanisms form a complementary and interconnected framework of immune evasion tactics that reinforce one another, creating a cohesive strategy for HRV to evade immune detection and maintain persistence. Our findings support a paradigm shift toward mechanism-based frameworks in virology, guiding vaccine design and antiviral strategies beyond pathogen-specific models.

This repository contains our code and results for each of the four methods of the analyses we performed.
